# Changelog - Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Named Routes**: Added names to all internal API routes (prefix `hypercacheio.`) for easier identification and management.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Changed
- **Renaming**: Rebranded the package from **Hypercachio** to **Hypercacheio** throughout the entire codebase, including namespaces, class names, configuration files, and environment variables.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **SQLite Directory Storage**: Changed `sqlite_path` to define a directory instead of a file. The actual database is now stored as `hypercacheio.sqlite` within this folder, allowing for better organization of associated WAL and SHM files.
