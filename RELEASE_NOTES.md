# Release Notes - v1.3.1

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This patch release fixes a critical issue with distributed locking on Secondary nodes.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **Lock Reliability**: Fixed an issue where `Cache::lock()` and `release()` would fail silently on Secondary servers if `async_requests` was enabled (default). These operations are now forced to run synchronously to ensure they return the correct `true` or `false` result, regardless of the async configuration.

## 📦 Upgrade

```bash
composer update iperamuna/laravel-hypercacheio
```

This update is strongly recommended for all users operating in a Primary/Secondary cluster configuration.

# Release Notes - v1.3.0

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This major update introduces a new Connectivity Check command, improved async processing architecture, and significant code optimizations.

## ✨ New Features

*   **Connectivity Check Command**: Run `php artisan hypercacheio:connectivity-check` to instantly verify communication between your Primary and Secondary nodes. It tests all endpoints (Ping, Add, Get, Put, Delete, Lock) and provides a detailed report.
*   **Fire-and-Forget Architecture**: Async requests now use a robust Promise tracking system with graceful shutdown. This ensures that write operations from Secondary nodes return immediately to the user while guaranteeing completion in the background, eliminating previous reliability issues with fire-and-forget requests.

## 🛠 Improvements

*   **Refactoring**: Core logic has been optimized by extracting shared SQLite operations into the `InteractsWithSqlite` trait, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
*   **Configuration Alignment**: The `CacheController` now respects the specific store configuration defined in `config/cache.php`, ensuring consistency with the `HypercacheioStore` implementation.
*   **Testing**: The entire test suite has been converted to **Pest PHP** for cleaner, more expressive tests.

## 📦 Upgrade

```bash
composer update iperamuna/laravel-hypercacheio
```

This update is fully backward compatible. For best results, ensure your configuration files are up to date.

# Release Notes - v1.2.1

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This patch release adds names to the internal API routes for better identification and management within Laravel applications.

## ✨ New Features

*   **Named Routes**: All internal API routes now have names prefixed with `hypercacheio.`.
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.get`
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.add`
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.put`
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.forget`
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.lock`
    *   `hypercacheio.cache.release-lock`

This makes it easier to use these routes with Laravel's `route()` helper and improves visibility in tools like `php artisan route:list`.

## 📦 Upgrade

```bash
composer update iperamuna/laravel-hypercacheio
```

This update is drop-in compatible and recommended for all users.

# Release Notes - v1.2.0

**Laravel Hyper-Cache-IO**

This version introduces a complete rebrand of the package from **Hypercacheio** to **Hypercacheio**.

## 🔄 Rebranding & Renaming

*   **Namespace Change**: All classes are now under the `Iperamuna\Hypercacheio` namespace.
*   **Class Renaming**: Core classes have been renamed (e.g., `HypercacheioStore` -> `HypercacheioStore`).
*   **Configuration**: The config file is now `config/hypercacheio.php` and uses refined environment variables with the `HYPERCACHEIO_` prefix.
*   **Artisan Command**: The installation command is now `php artisan hypercacheio:install`.
*   **Routes**: Internal API routes now use the `/api/hypercacheio` prefix by default.

## 📦 Upgrade Guide

If you are upgrading from `v1.1.0` or earlier:

1.  **Update Composer**:
    ```bash
    composer require iperamuna/laravel-hypercacheio:^1.2
    ```
2.  **Update Configuration**:
    Rename your `config/hypercacheio.php` to `config/hypercacheio.php` and update the array keys. Alternatively, run the new install command:
    ```bash
    php artisan hypercacheio:install
    ```
3.  **Update Environment Variables**:
    Search your `.env` for `HYPERCACHEIO_` and replace with `HYPERCACHEIO_`.
4.  **Update Code References**:
    Any direct references to `Hypercacheio` classes or the `hypercacheio` cache driver should be updated to `Hypercacheio` and `hypercacheio` respectively.
